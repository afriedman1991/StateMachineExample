# StateMachineProject
An implementation of a state machine for animation management in Unity

To see the animations in action (and check out the code), UnityHub version 2.32 and Unity version 2019.4.2f1 are required. Code can be found in the Assets/Scripts folder.

Pull down the repository to your preferred directory, and open UnityHub. Click on the "ADD" button in UnityHub and find the project in the directory you saved it. Once the project is added, click on it in UnityHub and the Unity Editor will open up. At the top of the editor, click the play button and you'll be able to test the game.
